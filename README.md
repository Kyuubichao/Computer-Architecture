Not entirely a single-cycle-cpu, but close approximation?

1. Open up the .circ file using Logisim (Recommend downloading the .jar instead of the .exe and running that)
2. On the left pane in Logisim, unde the "Single Cycle CPU" folder, click the "Single-Cycle CPU" page to display what I had open in my YouTube video.
